"""A deleted or replaced board DB fails closed — it is never silently re-initialized.

Regression (live ops board): ``~/.hermes/kanban/boards/ops/kanban.db`` was deleted
while the gateway was running. ``connect()`` had the path in its process-local
``_INITIALIZED_PATHS`` cache, the open recreated an empty SQLite file, and the stale
cache entry was dropped so the full init path re-ran ``SCHEMA_SQL``. The board came
back EMPTY and every card on it was gone, with no error raised anywhere: the loss was
only visible as "my tasks disappeared". Recreating an empty board is never the right
recovery for a replaced DB — the operator restores a backup, or asks for a fresh
board explicitly. These tests pin that contract at each entry point:

* the cached fast path (``connect()`` after this process initialized the path),
* a fresh process (nothing cached — the durable per-board marker decides),
* the explicit admin path (``init_db(..., allow_recreate=True)``), which must still work.
