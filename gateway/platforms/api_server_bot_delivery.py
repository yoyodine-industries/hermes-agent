"""Receiver-side drainer for peer deliveries (spec §3.1 triggers 1-4).

``_bot_send_turn`` in ``api_server.py`` runs the delivery its own request was
admitted for. This module owns the other half of the acceptance promise: a
delivery that was accepted with ``receipt`` because the target's turn slot was
busy must still RUN once that slot frees. Without it the queue is write-only --
the live build held 53 ``queued`` records with a full body each and no code path
that advanced or expired a single one (VERIFICATION D1).

Four triggers converge here, all under the target's durable turn lock so a
drained delivery can never race the lock holder any more than a live request can:

1. admission -- :func:`drain_under_lock` keeps draining the queue under the lock
   the caller just acquired, until the caller's own delivery is at the head (or
   the caller's promised window elapses -- the caller then keeps its receipt).
2. turn end -- the same loop is what runs after each turn, so an idle target with
   a backlog drains it back-to-back instead of idling between chores.
3. the 30s sweep -- :func:`sweep_loop`, started beside ``_sweep_orphaned_runs``.
4. the hourly chore -- ``bot_delivery_queue.cleanup_bot_delivery_queue``.

The turn lock may be held by a UI/desktop session, not just a card worker (the
live build reproduced a 1800.3s lease wait against a desktop holder), so nothing
here expires or abandons a record merely because its target is mid-turn: the
holder is the one that will drain it.

    named in the log (``drain_budget_exhausted``) with its queued depth -- that skip
