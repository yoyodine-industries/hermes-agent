"""The Kanban author contract: who an author-attributing ``hermes kanban`` action is from.

One home for the resolution order — ``hermes_cli.kanban``, ``kanban_specify`` and
``kanban_decompose`` all delegate here so their mirrors cannot drift:

  1. an author bound by the calling surface for this call (:func:`bind_author` — the gateway
     passes the routed chat profile, its programmatic equivalent of ``--author``),
  2. ``kanban.review_profile`` from THIS home's config (:func:`home_author_profile`) — the
     identity the lane owning this home declares for its own board writes,
  3. ``HERMES_PROFILE_NAME``,
  4. ``HERMES_PROFILE``.

Anything else raises :class:`KanbanAuthorRequired`. There is deliberately NO home-DERIVED
fallback: ``HERMES_HOME`` follows ``hermes profile use``, so an unpinned caller used to
attribute its comments and status moves to whichever lane was last made active, and a
comment that reads as a human operator's can be a stale sticky profile's. Step 2 is not that
bug: the value is declared in this home's own ``config.yaml`` and read through the config
already scoped to this home, so another lane's activity cannot move it — and it sits BELOW a
call-bound author, so a multiplexed gateway still attributes to the routed chat's lane
instead of one home-wide name. Unset -> the ambient ``HERMES_PROFILE*`` signals decide,
exactly as before, and an unpinned caller still raises rather than naming a lane.
