"""Board metadata (``board.json``) and board lifecycle management for the Kanban DB:
read/write of per-board display metadata, board creation/discovery/archival, and the
``board.json``-as-identity-marker rule.

Split out of ``hermes_cli.kanban_db``; origin-resident helpers are reached
late-bound via ``_kb`` (import-cycle breaking) so monkeypatching
``kanban_db.<name>`` keeps working.

Dispatch admission (card t_17c9c847) lives here too: ``board_dispatch_enabled`` is the
one chokepoint that decides whether the dispatcher may serve a board, and
``list_dispatch_boards`` is the dispatcher's OWN enumeration — ``list_boards`` stays the
full inventory for the CLI and the dashboard, so an estate board is still VISIBLE on the
board list, it is simply never spawned from.
