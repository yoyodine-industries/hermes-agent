"""Shared YAML 1.1 policy for config, manifests, and frontmatter.

Ruamel's native schema includes bare y/n booleans and rejects duplicate keys.

where the engine cannot be imported, and every operation that needs it raises
``YamlEngineUnavailable``: a caller must never receive a missing engine as a parse result. A
caller that wants to branch deliberately asks ``engine_available()`` instead of being told.
