"""Turn-end guards for kanban workers, whose turn must END on the terminal board tool that
hands the card to whoever owns it next (``kanban_complete``, ``kanban_block``,
``kanban_request_review``, ``kanban_request_changes``), and must NOT end without one.

``build_kanban_stop_nudge`` covers the missing-handoff direction: some models narrate the
next step and stop with no tool calls; Hermes treats that as a clean exit → ``rc=0`` →
dispatcher ``protocol_violation``, so we return a bounded synthetic nudge instead of
exiting. ``terminal_handoff_status`` covers the landed-handoff direction: the agent loop
breaks its turn once a terminal call has succeeded, because the card already has a new
owner and a worker that keeps iterating acts on a task it no longer holds.

Policy-only: no board access, no state.
