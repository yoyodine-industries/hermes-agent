"""Durable, at-most-once handoff to an existing Bot Chat owner.

Adapted from FalconOrtiz's live-owner mailbox (#101564). A single private
record advances queued -> claimed -> terminal under a process-shared lock.
Claims never expire: a crashed consumer leaves an inspectable unknown outcome,
not permission to execute the same input again. Receipts are permanent.

A pinned lease is a destination only while its consumer proves it is still
consuming: the owner's poll loop renews the lease stamp
(``hermes_cli.active_sessions.touch_active_session_lease``) and an entry whose
stamp is older than ``LIVE_CONSUMER_TTL_SECONDS`` is not a live owner, however
alive its process is. Mail pinned to a lease that is gone is reclaimed by the
profile's current live owner along the same compression lineage — but only
after the session store proves the body is not already there, so a reclaim can
never run the same input twice.

Two lanes share the spool. Mail with a pinned ``owner`` is the live-owner lane
above. Mail with ``lane == LEASE_QUEUE_LANE`` is a conversation lane: a turn that
could not out-wait the conversation's session turn lease hands its inbound
delivery here, pinned to the conversation instead of to a lease (the holder it
failed to out-wait is exactly the holder it must not name as its own), and the
next turn admitted on that conversation drains it as its first user message. A
queue record is never claimable by the live-owner lane and vice versa.
